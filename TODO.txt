TODO for SolidWire:

- Error handling for the Blender export. If ANYTHING goes wrong, it needs to remove the temporary objects it creates and revert the names.
- If no name is specified in the Blender script, it should use the Object's name.
- Auto export NLAs for Blender script?
- High detail models chug hard when exporting.
- Stop Blender exporting a material when exporting (if possible).
- Blender script screws up on some lines (I think it has something to do with vert order, because converting to and from Curve fixes it a bit).

- In Unity, changing the mesh during runtime breaks the script.
- In Unity, irregular scales change the line colour intensity.
- Sometimes, removing dynamically made SolidWire meshes throws an error.
- Hard to click on most SolidWire objects in Unity.
