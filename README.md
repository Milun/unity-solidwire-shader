## Requirements

__Basic knowledge (and use) of Blender:__
This shader requires all meshes it's used with to have been exported using a custom SolidWire export script (provided in **/dist/io_export_solidwire_fbx.zip**).

## Overview

For an overview and in-depth guide on working with SolidWire, please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Milun/unity-solidwire-shader/wiki).

### Special thanks

A special thanks goes out to the friendly people of Unity's forums for helping me out when getting this project started.
